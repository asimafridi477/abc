Area

The Greek mathematician Archimedes discovered that the surface area of a sphere is the same as the lateral surface area of a cylinder having the same radius as the sphere and a height the length of the diameter of the sphere.Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object.

length

One of the oldest units of length measurement used in the ancient world was the 'cubit' which was the length of the arm from the tip of the finger to the elbow. As early as the middle of the tenth century it is believed that the Saxon king Edgar kept a "yardstick" at Winchester as the official standard of measurement.

Volume

The Simple English dictionary has a definition for: volume. The volume of an object is a measure of the amount of space occupied by that object, not to be confused with mass. The word volume implies a three-dimensional context where, by convention, the length is the longest distance between the object's extremities.

Mass

The earliest recorded systems of weights and measures originate in the 3rd or 4th millennium BC. Even the very earliest civilizations needed measurement for purposes of agriculture, construction, and trade.

Temperature

Around the same time, German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit met Olaus Roemer, a Danish astronomer, who developed an alcohol-based thermometer using wine. He marked two points on his thermometer — 60 to mark the temperature of boiling water and 7.5 as the point where ice melted.
